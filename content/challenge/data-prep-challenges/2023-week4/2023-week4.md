## Requirements
- Input the data
- We want to stack the tables on top of one another, since they have 
the same fields in each sheet.
- Some of the fields aren't matching up as we'd expect, due to 
differences in spelling. Merge these fields together
- Make a Joining Date field based on the Joining Day, Table Names 
and the year 2023
- Now we want to reshape our data so we have a field for each 
demographic, for each new customer 
- Make sure all the data types are correct for each field
- Remove duplicates
  - If a customer appears multiple times take their earliest joining 
  date
- Output the data

## Data Cleaning
The data cleaning was performed within R. The tables for each month 
were saved to individual csv files from the original excel 
spreadsheet data and imported into R. The R code can be found 
[here](../week4.R).

- **Some of the fields aren't matching up as we'd expect, due to 
differences in spelling. Merge these fields together**
   ```{r}
   data <- clean_names(data)
   data <- data %>%
     rename(demographic = demagraphic) %>%
     rename(demographic = demographiic)
   ```
   
- **Make a Joining Date field based on the Joining Day, Table 
Names and the year 2023**
   ```{r}
   mutate(.data = data, joining_date = as.Date(paste(joining_day, "01", "2023", sep = "-"), format = "%d-%m-%Y"))
   ```

- **Reshape our data so we have a field for each demographic, for 
each new customer**
   ```{r}
   pivot_wider(data, names_from = demographic, values_from = value)
   data <- clean_names(data)
   ```

- **We want to stack the tables on top of one another, since they have 
the same fields in each sheet.**
   ```{r}
   df_join <- full_join(data1, data2, join_by(x$id == y$id,
        x$joining_day == y$joining_day,
        x$joining_date == y$joining_date,
        x$ethnicity == y$ethnicity,
        x$date_of_birth == y$date_of_birth,
        x$account_type == y$account_type))
   ```

- **Output the data**

## 2023 Data Prep Challenge Week #1

[source](https://preppindata.blogspot.com/2023/01/2023-week-1-data-source-bank.html?m=1)

## Requirements
- Input the data
- Split the Transaction Code to extract the letters at the start of the transaction code. These identify the bank who processes the transaction
  - Rename the new field with the Bank code 'Bank'. 
- Rename the values in the Online or In-person field, Online of the 1 values and In-Person for the 2 values.
- Change the date to be the day of the week
- Different levels of detail are required in the outputs. You will need to sum up the values of the transactions in three ways:
  1. Total Values of Transactions by each bank
  2. Total Values by Bank, Day of the Week and Type of Transaction (Online or In-Person)
  3. Total Values by Bank and Customer Code
- Output each data file

## Data Cleaning
- **Input the data**
  - Import the data into a spreadsheet
- **Split the Transaction Code to extract the letters at the start of the transaction code**
  - Create a column to the right of Transaction Code
  - Label the new column as 'Bank' in B1
  - In B2 enter the formula:
    * ```=LEFT(A2, FIND("-", A2, 1) - 1)```
  - Fill the formula for all rows
- **Rename the values in the Online or In-person field: "Online" for 
values of 1, "In-Person" for values of 2**
  - Create a new column to the left of Online or In-person Field
  - Label the new column as "Online/In-Person"
  - In E2 enter the formula
    * ```=IF(F2 = 2, "In-Person", IF(F2 = 1, "Online", ""), "")```
  - Fill the formula for all rows
  - Copy the values of the formula into the Online or In-person Column
  - Remove temporary column E
- **Change the date to be the day of the week**
  - Create five (5) new columns: F, H, I, J, K
  - In H2 extract the date with the formula
    * ```=LEFT(G2, 10)```
    * Fill the formula for all rows
  - In I2 extract the year from the date with the formula
    * ```=RIGHT(H2,4)```
    * Fill the formula for all rows
  - In J2 extract the month from the date with the formula
    * ```=MID(H2, 4, 2)```
    * Fill the formula for all rows
  - In K2 extract the day from the date with the formula
    * ```=LEFT(H2, 2)```
    * Fill the formula for all rows
  - In F2 compute the day of the week with the formula
    * ```=TEXT(DATE(I2, J2, K2), "dddd")```
    * Fill the formula for all rows
    * Copy the values of the formula into the Transaction Date column
    * Remove temporary columns F, H, I, J, K

### Output Data
#### Total Values of Transactions by each Bank
- Different levels of detail are required in the outputs. You will need to sum up the values of the transactions in three ways:
  * Total Values of Transactions by each bank
    + Enter SQL statement with cleaned data imported as table week1

```{sql}
-- Total Values of Transactions by each bank
SELECT Bank,
   SUM(Value) as Totals 
FROM week1 
GROUP BY Bank;
```

[Data File of Total Values of Transactions by each bank](../output-data-1.csv)

#### Total Values by Bank, Day of the Week, and Type of Transaction
- Different levels of detail are required in the outputs. You will need to sum up the values of the transactions in three ways:
  * Total Values by Bank, Day of the Week and Type of Transaction (Online or In-Person)
    + Enter SQL statement with cleaned data imported as table week1

```{sql}
-- Total Values by Bank, Day of the Week and Type of Transaction (Online or In-Person)
SELECT Bank,
   SUM(Value),
   `Transaction Date`,
   `Online or In-Person`
FROM week1
GROUP BY Bank,
   `Transaction Date`,
   `Online or In-Person`;
```

#### Total Values by Bank and Customer Code
- Different levels of detail are required in the outputs. You will need to sum up the values of the transactions in three ways:
  * Total Values by Bank and Customer Code
    + Enter SQL statement with cleaned data imported as table week1

```{sql}
-- Total Values by Bank and Customer Code
SELECT Bank,
   SUM(Value),
  `Customer Code`
FROM week1
GROUP BY Bank,
   `Customer Code`;
```

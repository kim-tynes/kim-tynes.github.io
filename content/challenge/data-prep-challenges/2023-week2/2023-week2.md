## Requirements
- Input the data
- In the Transactions table, there is a Sort Code field which 
contains dashes. We need to remove these so just have a 6 digit 
string
- Use the SWIFT Bank Code lookup table to bring in additional 
information about the SWIFT code and Check Digits of the receiving 
bank account
- Add a field for the Country Code
- Create the IBAN as above
- Remove unnecessary fields
- Output the data

## Data Cleaning
- **Input the data**
  - Import ```Transactions.csv``` and ```Swift Codes.csv``` into spreadsheet
- **In the Transactions table, remove dashes in Sort Code field so 
there is just a 6-digit string**
  - Create a new column D and enter the following formula in D2:
    - ```=SUBSTITUTE(C2,"-","")```
  - Fill formula for all rows
  - Copy the values of the formula from column D to the Sort Code column
  - Remove column D
- **Use the SWIFT Bank Code lookup table to bring in additional 
information about the SWIFT code and Check Digits of the receiving 
bank account**
  - Copy Swift Codes table to new sheet with Transactions Table
  - **Add a field for the Country Code**
    - Label Column E of Transactions Table "Country Code"
    - Enter the text "GB" for all rows
  - **Create the IBAN**
    - IBAN, in order, consists of:
      - Country Code
      - Check Digits
      - Bank Code
      - Sort Code
      - Account Number
    - Label column F of Transactions Table "IBAN" and enter the following formula:
      - ```=E2&VLOOKUP(D2, $'Swift Codes'.$A:$C, 3, 0)&VLOOKUP(D2, $'Swift Codes'.$A:$C, 2, 0)&C2&B2```

- **Remove unnecessary fields**
  - Delete all columns except for Transaction ID (column A) and IBAN (column F)
- **[Output data](../Transactions_cleaned.csv)**

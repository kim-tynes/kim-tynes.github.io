I am currently an IT Technician. I have over two years 
professional experience with account management using Active 
Directory and Microsoft 365. I am also proficient with 
creating and maintaining end-user documentation.

In the realm of Data Analytics I have beginner experience 
in SQL, R, Python, and Tableau. SQLite is my RDBMS of choice 
for personal projects.

I am also a hobby software developer with five years school 
experience using C++. Learning golang, Rust, Qt, and 
JavaScript in my spare time.

My hobbies include music, gaming, and tinkering.
